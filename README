Run the createptracker.sql script against a db
Edit the db connection string in the web.conf file.
Edit all the files in the setup directory to the same connection string. I was too lazy at the time to reference the main connection string from the web.conf file.
Basically just do a find and replace with the word "password".
That's pretty much it I guess.
